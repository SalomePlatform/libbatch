### Initialisation performed by CONFIGURE_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE:
@PACKAGE_INIT@

### First the generic stuff for a standard module:
SET(LIBBATCH_INCLUDE_DIRS "@PACKAGE_CONF_INCLUDE_DIRS@")

# Load the dependencies for the libraries of @PROJECT_NAME@ 
# (contains definitions for IMPORTED targets). This is only 
# imported if we are not built as a subproject (in this case targets are already there)
IF(NOT batch AND NOT @PROJECT_NAME@_BINARY_DIR)
  INCLUDE("@PACKAGE_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIG_DIR@/@PROJECT_NAME@Targets.cmake")
ENDIF()   

# These are IMPORTED targets created by @PROJECT_NAME@Targets.cmake
SET(LIBBATCH_LIBRARIES batch)

# Package root dir:
SET_AND_CHECK(LIBBATCH_ROOT_DIR_EXP "@PACKAGE_CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@")

#### Now the specificities

# Options exported by the package:
SET(LIBBATCH_LOCAL_SUBMISSION @LIBBATCH_LOCAL_SUBMISSION@)
SET(LIBBATCH_PYTHON_WRAPPING @LIBBATCH_PYTHON_WRAPPING@)

SET_AND_CHECK(PTHREAD_ROOT_DIR_EXP "@PACKAGE_PTHREAD_ROOT_DIR@")

IF(LIBBATCH_PYTHON_WRAPPING)
  SET_AND_CHECK(LIBBATCH_PYTHONPATH "@PACKAGE_LIBBATCH_PYTHONPATH@")
  SET_AND_CHECK(PYTHON_ROOT_DIR_EXP "@PACKAGE_PYTHON_ROOT_DIR@")
  SET_AND_CHECK(SWIG_ROOT_DIR_EXP "@PACKAGE_SWIG_ROOT_DIR@")
ENDIF()
